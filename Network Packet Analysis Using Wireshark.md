# Introduction
This report presents the findings from a beginner-level network packet capture and analysis
project conducted using Wireshark, a widely-used network protocol analyzer. The objective was
to capture and analyze network traffic to understand communication patterns, identify protocols, and detect potential security threats. The analysis is based on two data sources: the provided
packet capture file, "Network packet capture.txt" containing Ethernet frame data, and an image
file, "network capture expert info.png" providing a summary of expert information from the
capture. This report integrates both analyses, with a particular focus on detecting suspicious
patterns, protocol anomalies, and potential intrusions, and concludes with a detailed account of
detected threats and mitigation strategies.

# Methodology
## 1. Tools Used :
  Wireshark: Utilized for importing, dissecting, and analyzing the packet capture data from
  the text file. 
  Image Analysis: The image "network capture expert info.png" was analyzed to extract
  expert information summaries, focusing on detected anomalies and issues.
