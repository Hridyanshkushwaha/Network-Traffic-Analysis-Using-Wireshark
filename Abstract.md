This report presents a comprehensive analysis of network traffic using Wireshark to
understand protocol behavior, detect anomalies, and identify potential security threats. The analysis is based on two primary data sources : a packet capture file and a expert
information summary from file. The packet capture revealed communication through
IPv6 with protocols like UDP, TCP, ESP, and ICMPv6, indicating typical internet
traffic with dominant UDP usage. Key packet structures, source-destination addresses, and traffic patterns were analyzed to interpret network behaviour.
The expert analysis highlighted multiple protocol anomalies, malformed packets, sequence issues, and decryption failures. Notable finding included malformed TCP
packets, protocol misuse in TLS and QUIC, and legacy encryption usage. These
indicators suggests possible intrusion attempts, protocol exploitation and potential
MITM or replay attacks.
This report outlines detailed mitigation strategies including strict protocol compilence, deep packet inspection, intrusion detection systems, and encryption policy
enforcement. The project enhances awareness of packet-level traffic patterns and
threat detection, offering a solid foundation for network security practices. Overall it
demonstrates how effective packet analysis can aid in proactively identifying and
mitigating security vulnerabilities in modern networks
