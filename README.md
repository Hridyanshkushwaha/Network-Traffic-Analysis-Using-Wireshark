# Network-Traffic-Analysis-Using-Wireshark
 This repository is the project work I have done in my summer internship in "Cybersecurity"  with the help of IBM.  This report presents a comprehensive analysis of network traffic using Wireshark to understand protocol behavior.
#### A full length pdf to study the project report is here [Comprehensive Network Packet Analysis Report1.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21472520/Comprehensive.Network.Packet.Analysis.Report1.pdf)

Wireshark is arguably the most popular and powerful tool you can use to capture, analyze and troubleshoot network traffic. The only downside you will face when using a tool as verbose as Wireshark is memorizing all of the commands, flags, filters, and syntax. Thatâ€™s where we come in.
Whether you are a network administrator, a security professional, or just someone curious about how networks work, learning to use Wireshark is a valuable skill.
Wireshark provides a user-friendly graphical interface, which displays captured packets with detailed information such as source and destination addresses, protocol types, and packet content. Users can apply filters to analyze specific types of traffic, search through capture files, and visualize network patterns. Additionally, Wireshark supports both wired and wireless networks, including advanced features like packet decryption for encrypted protocols like SSL/TLS.
