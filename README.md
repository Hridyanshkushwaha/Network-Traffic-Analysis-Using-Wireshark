# Network-Traffic-Analysis-Using-Wireshark
 This repository is the project work I have done in my summer internship in "Cybersecurity"  with the help of IBM.  This report presents a comprehensive analysis of network traffic using Wireshark to understand protocol behavior.
#### A full length pdf to study the project report is here [Comprehensive Network Packet Analysis Report1.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21472520/Comprehensive.Network.Packet.Analysis.Report1.pdf)
